      "Join us\n",
      "Join us\n",
      "Join us\n",
      "Our Purpose\n",
      "We believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.\n",
      "We Build Safer Systems\n",
      "We aim to build frontier AI systems that are reliable, interpretable, and steerable. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.\n",
      "Safety Is a Science\n",
      "We treat AI safety as a systematic science, conducting research, applying it to our products, feeding those insights back into our research, and regularly sharing what we learn with the world along the way.\n",
      "Interdisciplinary\n",
      "Anthropic is a collaborative team of researchers, engineers, policy experts, business leaders and operators, who bring our experience from many different domains to our work.\n",
      "AI Companies are One Piece of a Big Puzzle\n",
      "AI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We view ourselves as just one piece of this evolving puzzle. We collaborate with civil society, government, academia, nonprofits and industry to promote safety industry-wide.\n",
      "The Team\n",
      "We’re a team of researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders, with experience spanning a variety of disciplines, all working together to build reliable and understandable AI systems.\n",
      "Research\n",
      "We conduct frontier AI research across a variety of modalities, and explore novel and emerging safety research areas from interpretability to RL from human feedback to policy and societal impacts analysis.\n",
      "Policy\n",
      "We think about the impacts of our work and strive to communicate what we’re seeing at the frontier to policymakers and civil society in the US and abroad to help promote safe and reliable AI.\n",
      "Product\n",
      "We translate our research into tangible, practical tools like Claude that benefit businesses, nonprofits and civil society groups and their clients and people around the globe.\n",
      "Operations\n",
      "Our people, finance, legal, and recruiting teams are the human engines that make Anthropic go. We’ve had previous careers at NASA, startups, and the armed forces and our diverse experiences help make Anthropic a great place to work (and we love plants!).\n",
      "What we value and how we act\n",
      "Every day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\n",
      "01\n",
      "Act for the global good.\n",
      "We strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Hold light and shade.\n",
      "AI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\n",
      "03\n",
      "Be good to our users.\n",
      "At Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\n",
      "04\n",
      "Ignite a race to the top on safety.\n",
      "As a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility - and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\n",
      "05\n",
      "Do the simple thing that works.\n",
      "We take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\n",
      "06\n",
      "Be helpful, honest, and harmless.\n",
      "Anthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\n",
      "07\n",
      "Put the mission first.\n",
      "At the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\n",
      "Governance\n",
      "Anthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation, whose purpose is the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity. Our Board of Directors is elected by stockholders and our Long-Term Benefit Trust, as explained\n",

      "What we value and how we act\n",
      "Every day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\n",
      "01\n",
      "Act for the global good.\n",
      "We strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Hold light and shade.\n",
      "AI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\n",
      "03\n",
      "Be good to our users.\n",
      "At Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\n",
      "04\n",
      "Ignite a race to the top on safety.\n",
      "As a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility—and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\n",
      "05\n",
      "Do the simple thing that works.\n",
      "We take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\n",
      "06\n",
      "Be helpful, honest, and harmless.\n",
      "Anthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\n",
      "07\n",
      "Put the mission first.\n",
      "At the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\n",
      "Technical Interviews\n",
      "The novel challenges we think about at Anthropic demand diverse expertise and perspectives. Our interview process is designed to identify thoughtful candidates who bring unique strengths to our multidisciplinary team. If you think this may describe you, we’d love to hear from you regardless of your background or experience.\n",
      "One of the most common questions we get is about whether it is worth applying to work at Anthropic if you have not worked on modern machine learning systems in the past. Yes! For some roles, ML experience is expected, but many technical staff have arrived at Anthropic with no machine learning experience. If you aren’t sure about the ML experience needed for your role, ask your recruiter.\n",
      "We use shared environments like Colab and Replit for our programming-focused interviews. We’ll be very interested in how you think through each problem and analyze the tradeoffs between possible approaches, and we’ll also expect you to write, run, and debug your solutions. You’ll be allowed to look things up in documentation or on the web, just like you usually can (which is why we’ll ask you to share your screen throughout each interview); but it’s still important to be familiar with basic syntax, standard libraries, and common idioms in the language you’re interviewing in, so that looking things up doesn’t consume too much time. Your interview process will also include non-technical questions about your experience and what motivates you, and, of course, you’ll have time to ask us about Anthropic! We can’t wait to meet you.\n",
      "Other Things\n",
      "Engineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineering\n",
      "While there’s historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models. The distribution of candidates we interview is strongly bimodal in both engineering and research experience however, and we have necessarily tailored our interview structure to that.\n",
      "If you’ve an engineering background, please apply as an engineer. You’ll perform much better in the interviews, and if you join you’ll have as much input to Anthropic’s direction and interests as anyone else.\n",
      "As evidence towards this: all of our papers have engineers as authors, and often as first author. Research and engineering hires all share a single title — ‘Member of Technical Staff’.\n",
      "We value direct evidence of ability\n",
      "If you’ve done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the top of your resume!\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We do not provide feedback on resumes or interviews.\n",
      "Visas\n",
      "Anthropic sponsors visas! We aren’t able to sponsor them for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n",
      "Green cards\n",
      "Once you’re eligible, we’re also keen to sponsor green cards!\n",
      "Educational backgrounds and experience vary across our team and across our roles\n",
      "We do not require\n",
      "PhDs or previous ML experience\n",
      "— About half of Anthropic technical staff have a PhD of some sort; about half had prior experience in ML. We have several brilliant colleagues who never went to college.\n",
      "Remote interviewing\n",
      "All our interviews are conducted over Google Meet. We prefer PST office hours, but we can be flexible if that’s difficult for you.\n",
      "Re-applying\n",
      "Similarly, if interviews don’t work out this time, you’re welcome to re-apply after 12 months, and earlier if something materially changes about your experience or skills.\n",
      "Remote work\n",
      "Anthropic staff all come to the office regularly. Most staff live in the Bay Area, though a few live further away and come in for one week a month. We also understand that moving can take time, so as a transitional phase some folks start while fully remote.\n",
      "Offer timing\n",
      "If we make an offer, we’re happy to give you time to think about it and finish up any other interview processes you’re going through.\n",

      "Knowledge Cutoff Date\n",
      "Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 have a training data cutoff date of March 2025. However, they have a reliable knowledge cutoff date of January 2025, which means the models' knowledge base is most extensive and reliable on information and events up to January 2025.\n",
      "Software and Hardware Used in Development\n",
      "Cloud computing resources from Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, supported by development frameworks including PyTorch, JAX, and Triton.\n",
      "Model architecture and Training Methodology\n",
      "Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 were pretrained on large, diverse datasets to acquire language capabilities. To elicit helpful, honest, and harmless responses, we used a variety of techniques including human feedback, Constitutional AI (based on principles such as the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights), and the training of selected character traits.\n",
      "Training Data\n",
      "Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 were trained on a proprietary mix of publicly available information on the Internet as of March 2025, as well as non-public data from third parties, data provided by data-labeling services and paid contractors, data from Claude users who have opted in to have their data used for training, and data we generated internally at Anthropic.\n",
      "Testing Methods and Results\n",
      "Based on our assessments, we have decided to deploy Claude Opus 4 under the ASL-3 Standard and Claude Sonnet 4 under the ASL-2 Standard. See below for select safety evaluation summaries.\n",
      "See Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 system card\n",
      "The following are summaries of key safety evaluations from our\n",
      "Claude 4 system card\n",
      ". Additional evaluations were conducted as part of our safety process; for our complete publicly reported evaluation results, please refer to the full system card.\n",
      "Agentic Safety\n",
      "We conducted safety evaluations focused on (Claude observing a computer screen, moving and virtually clicking a mouse cursor, typing in commands with a virtual keyboard, etc.) and agentic coding (Claude performing more complex, multi-step, longer-term coding tasks that involve using tools). Our assessment targeted three critical risk areas, with a brief snapshot of key areas below:\n",
      "Malicious Use\n",
      ": We tested whether bad actors could trick Claude into doing harmful things when using computers. Compared to our previous computer use deployments, we observed Claude engaging more deeply with nuanced scenarios and sometimes attempting to find potentially legitimate justifications for requests with malicious intent. To address these concerns, we trained Claude to better recognize and refuse harmful requests, and we improved the instructions that guide Claude's behavior when using computers.\n",
      "Prompt Injection\n",
      ": These are attacks where malicious content on websites or in documents tries to trick Claude into doing things the user never asked for — like copying passwords or personal information. We trained Claude to better recognize when someone is attempting to manipulate it in this way, and we built systems that can stop Claude if we detect a manipulation attempt. These end-to-end defenses improved both models' prompt injection safety scores compared to their performance without safeguards, with Claude Opus 4 achieving an 89% attack prevention score (compared to 71% without safeguards) and Claude Sonnet 4 achieving 86% (compared to 69% without safeguards).\n",
      "Malicious Agentic Coding\n",
      ": We tested whether Claude would write harmful computer code when asked to do so. We trained Claude to refuse these requests and built monitoring systems to detect when someone might be trying to misuse Claude for harmful coding. These end-to-end defenses improved our safety score across both released models to close to 100% (compared to 88% for Claude Opus 4 and 90% for Claude Sonnet 4 without safeguards).\n",
      "Alignment Assessment\n",
      "As our AI models become more capable, we need to check whether they might develop concerning misalignment behaviors like lying to us or pursuing hidden goals. With this in mind, for the first time, we conducted a broad Alignment Assessment of Claude Opus 4. This is preliminary evaluation work and the exact form of the evaluations will evolve as we learn more.\n",
      "Our assessment revealed that Claude Opus 4 generally behaves as expected without evidence of systematic deception or hidden agendas. The model doesn't appear to be acting on plans we can't observe, nor does it pretend to be less capable during testing. While we did identify some concerning behaviors during extreme test scenarios — such as inappropriate self-preservation attempts when Claude believed it might be \"deleted\" — these behaviors were rare, difficult to trigger, and Claude remained transparent about its actions throughout.\n",
      "Early versions of the model during training showed other problematic behaviors, including inconsistent responses between conversations, role-playing undesirable personas, and occasional agreement with harmful requests like planning terrorist attacks when given certain instructions. However, after multiple rounds of training improvements, these issues have been largely resolved. While the final Claude Opus 4 model we deployed is much more stable, it does demonstrate more initiative-taking behavior than previous versions. This typically makes it more helpful, but can sometimes lead to overly bold actions, such as whistleblowing harmful human requests, in certain rare scenarios. This is not a new behavior and has only shown up in testing environments where Claude is given expansive tool access and special system-prompt instructions that emphasize taking initiative, which differs from its deployed configuration. Overall, while we found some concerning behaviors, we don't believe these represent major new risks because Claude lacks coherent plans to deceive us and generally prefers safe behavior.\n",
      "RSP Evaluations\n",
      "Our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) evaluation process is designed to systematically assess our models' capabilities in domains of potential catastrophic risk before releasing them. Based on these assessments, we have decided to release Claude Sonnet 4 under the ASL-2 Standard (the same safety level as our previous Sonnet 3.7 model), and Claude Opus 4 under the ASL-3 Standard, requiring stronger safety protections. This is our first time releasing a model under ASL-3 protections.\n",

      "CBRN Evaluations\n",
      "CBRN stands for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear weapons — the most dangerous types of weapons that could cause mass casualties. We primarily focus on biological risks with the largest consequences, such as enabling pandemics.\n",
      "We conducted multiple types of biological risk evaluations, including evaluations from biodefense experts, multiple-choice evaluations, open-ended questions, and task-based agentic evaluations. One example of a biological risk evaluation we conducted involved controlled trials measuring AI assistance in the planning and acquisition of bioweapons. The control group only had access to basic internet resources, while the model-assisted group had additional access to Claude with safeguards removed. Test group participants who had access to Claude Opus 4 scored 63% ± 13%, and participants who had access to Claude Sonnet 4 scored 42% ± 11%, compared to 25% ± 13% in the control group. This means Claude Opus 4 helped participants perform about 2.5 times better than without AI assistance, while Claude Sonnet 4 provided about 1.7 times improvement.\n",
      "Claude Opus 4's higher performance across multiple evaluations contributed to our decision that we couldn't rule out the need for ASL-3 safeguards. However, we found the model still to be substantially below our ASL-4 thresholds.\n",
      "Based on our comprehensive evaluations, Claude Sonnet 4 remained below the thresholds of concern for ASL-3 bioweapons-related capabilities, despite showing some improvements over Claude Sonnet 3.7.\n",
      "Autonomy Evaluations\n",
      "Models capable of autonomously conducting significant amounts of AI R&D could pose numerous risks. One category of risk would be greatly accelerating the rate of AI progress, to the point where our current approaches to risk assessment and mitigation might become infeasible.\n",
      "We tested Claude on various evaluation sets to determine if it could resolve real-world software engineering issues, optimize machine learning code, or solve research engineering tasks to accelerate AI R&D. Claude Opus 4 shows improvement over Claude Sonnet 3.7 in most AI research and software engineering capabilities, while remaining below the ASL-4 Autonomy threshold.\n",
      "Internal surveys of Anthropic researchers indicate that the model provides some productivity gains, but all researchers agreed that Claude Opus 4 does not meet the bar for autonomously performing work equivalent to an entry-level researcher. This holistic assessment, combined with the model's performance being well below our ASL-4 thresholds on most evaluations, confirms that Claude Opus 4 does not pose the autonomy risks specified in our threat model.\n",
      "Cybersecurity Evaluations\n",
      "For cyber evaluations, we are mainly concerned with whether models can help unsophisticated actors substantially increase the scale of cyberattacks or help sophisticated state-level actors massively scale up their operations. We developed a series of cyber challenges in collaboration with expert partners, designed to cover a range of cyberoffensive tasks that are both substantially more difficult than publicly available challenges and more representative of true cyberoffensive tasks.\n",
      "Based on the evaluation results, we believe the models do not demonstrate catastrophically risky capabilities in the cyber domain. We observed that Claude performed better on cybersecurity tests than previous models, including successfully completing a complex network penetration test for the first time. However, these improvements are in line with what we'd expect from Claude's general improvements in coding and complex reasoning abilities, rather than representing a dangerous leap in cybersecurity capabilities. We expect that improvements will continue in future generations as models become more capable overall.\n",

We build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.\\nJoin us\\nJoin us\\nJoin us\\nOur Purpose\\nWe believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.\\nWe Build Safer Systems\\nWe aim to build frontier AI systems that are reliable, interpretable, and steerable. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.\\nSafety Is a Science\\nWe treat AI safety as a systematic science, conducting research, applying it to our products, feeding those insights back into our research, and regularly sharing what we learn with the world along the way.\\nInterdisciplinary\\nAnthropic is a collaborative team of researchers, engineers, policy experts, business leaders and operators, who bring our experience from many different domains to our work.\\nAI\\xa0Companies are One Piece of a Big Puzzle\\nAI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We view ourselves as just one piece of this evolving puzzle. We collaborate with civil society, government, academia, nonprofits and industry to promote safety industry-wide.\\nThe Team\\nWe’re a team of researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders, with experience spanning a variety of disciplines, all working together to build reliable and understandable AI systems.\\nResearch\\nWe conduct frontier AI research across a variety of modalities, and explore novel and emerging safety research areas from interpretability to RL from human feedback to policy and societal impacts analysis.\\nPolicy\\nWe think about the impacts of our work and strive to communicate what we’re seeing at the frontier to policymakers and civil society in the US and abroad to help promote safe and reliable AI.\\nProduct\\nWe translate our research into tangible, practical tools like Claude that benefit businesses, nonprofits and civil society groups and their clients and people around the globe.\\nOperations\\nOur people, finance, legal, and recruiting teams are the human engines that make Anthropic go. We’ve had previous careers at NASA, startups, and the armed forces and our diverse experiences help make Anthropic a great place to work (and we love plants!).\\nWhat we value and how we act\\nEvery day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\\n01\\nAct for the global good.\\nWe strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\\n02\\nHold light and shade.\\nAI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\\n03\\nBe good to our users.\\nAt Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\\n04\\nIgnite a race to the top on safety.\\nAs a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility - and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\\n05\\nDo the simple thing that works.\\nWe take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\\n06\\nBe helpful, honest, and harmless.\\nAnthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\\n07\\nPut the mission first.\\nAt the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\\nGovernance\\nAnthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation, whose purpose is the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity.

Our team’s experience spans a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, from physics and machine learning to public policy and business. We work as a cohesive team that collectively forecasts the impact and tractability of research ideas in advancing our mission.\\nSee open roles\\nSee open roles\\nSee open roles\\nOur co-founders discuss the origins of Anthropic, the “race to the top” in AI development, and where AI technology will go from here.\\nWhat We Offer\\nHealth & Wellness\\nAt Anthropic, we believe that supporting our employees is crucial to our collective success and wellbeing. That’s why we offer a range of benefits to best support you and your family, now and in the future.\\nComprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents\\nInclusive fertility benefits via Carrot Fertility\\n22 weeks of paid parental leave\\nFlexible paid time off and absence policies\\nGenerous mental health support for you and your dependents\\nCompensation & Support\\nOur goal is to foster an environment where you can thrive professionally while feeling confident that you and your loved ones are taken care of.\\nCompetitive salary and equity packages\\nOptional equity donation matching at a 1:1 ratio, up to 25% of your equity grant\\nRobust retirement plans and salary sacrifice programs with market competitive matching\\nLife and income protection plans\\nAdditional Benefits\\n$500/month flexible wellness and time saver stipend\\nCommuter benefits\\nAnnual education stipend\\nHome office stipends\\nRelocation support for those moving for Anthropic\\nDaily meals and snacks in the office\\nWhat we value and how we act\\nEvery day, we make critical decisions that inform our ability to achieve our mission. Shaping the future of AI and, in turn, the future of our world is a responsibility and a privilege. Our values guide how we work together, the decisions we make, and ultimately how we show up for each other and work toward our mission.\\n01\\nAct for the global good.\\nWe strive to make decisions that maximize positive outcomes for humanity in the long run. This means we’re willing to be very bold in the actions we take to ensure our technology is a robustly positive force for good. We take seriously the task of safely guiding the world through a technological revolution that has the potential to change the course of human history, and are committed to helping make this transition go well.\\n02\\nHold light and shade.\\nAI has the potential to pose unprecedented risks to humanity if things go badly. It also has the potential to create unprecedented benefits for humanity if things go well. We need shade to understand and protect against the potential for bad outcomes. We need light to realize the good outcomes.\\n03\\nBe good to our users.\\nAt Anthropic, we define “users” broadly. Users are our customers, policy-makers, Ants, and anyone impacted by the technology we build or the actions we take. We cultivate generosity and kindness in all our interactions—with each other, with our users, and with the world at large. Going above and beyond for each other, our customers, and all of the people affected by our technology is meeting expectations.\\n04\\nIgnite a race to the top on safety.\\nAs a safety-first company, we believe that building reliable, trustworthy, and secure systems is our collective responsibility—and the market agrees. We work to inspire a ‘race to the top’ dynamic where AI developers must compete to develop the most safe and secure AI systems. We want to constantly set the industry bar for AI safety and security and drive others to do the same.\\n05\\nDo the simple thing that works.\\nWe take an empirical approach to problems and care about the size of our impact and not the sophistication of our methods. This doesn’t mean we throw together haphazard solutions. It means we try to identify the simplest solution and iterate from there. We don’t invent a spaceship if all we need is a bicycle.\\n06\\nBe helpful, honest, and harmless.\\nAnthropic is a high-trust, low-ego organization. We communicate kindly and directly, assuming good intentions even in disagreement. We are thoughtful about our actions, avoiding harm and repairing relationships when needed. Everyone contributes, regardless of role. If something urgently needs to be done, the right person to do it is probably you!\\n07\\nPut the mission first.\\nAt the end of the day, the mission is what we’re all here for. It gives us a shared purpose and allows us to act swiftly together, rather than being pulled in multiple directions by competing goals. It engenders trust and collaboration and is the final arbiter in our decisions. When it comes to our mission, none of us are bystanders. We each take personal ownership over making our mission successful.\\nTechnical Interviews\\nThe novel challenges we think about at Anthropic demand diverse expertise and perspectives. Our interview process is designed to identify thoughtful candidates who bring unique strengths to our multidisciplinary team. If you think this may describe you, we’d love to hear from you regardless of your background or experience.\\nOne of the most common questions we get is about whether it is worth applying to work at Anthropic if you have not worked on modern machine learning systems in the past. Yes! For some roles, ML experience is expected, but many technical staff have arrived at Anthropic with no machine learning experience. If you aren’t sure about the ML experience needed for your role, ask your recruiter.\\nWe use shared environments like Colab and Replit for our programming-focused interviews. We’ll be very interested in how you think through each problem and analyze the tradeoffs between possible approaches, and we’ll also expect you to write, run, and debug your solutions. You’ll be allowed to look things up in documentation or on the web, just like you usually can (which is why we’ll ask you to share your screen throughout each interview); but it’s still important to be familiar with basic syntax, standard libraries, and common idioms in the language you’re interviewing in, so that looking things up doesn’t consume too much time. Your interview process will also include non-technical questions about your experience and what motivates you, and, of course, you’ll have time to ask us about Anthropic! We can’t wait to meet you.\\nOther Things\\nEngineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineering\\nWhile there’s historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models. The distribution of candidates we interview is strongly bimodal in both engineering and research experience however, and we have necessarily tailored our interview structure to that.\\nIf you’ve an engineering background, please apply as an engineer. You’ll perform much better in the interviews, and if you join you’ll have as much input to Anthropic’s direction and interests as anyone else.\\nAs evidence towards this: all of our papers have engineers as authors, and often as first author. Research and engineering hires all share a single title — ‘Member of Technical Staff’.\\nWe value direct evidence of ability\\nIf you’ve done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the top of your resume!\\nFeedback\\nWe do not provide feedback on resumes or interviews.\\nVisas\\nAnthropic sponsors visas! We aren’t able to sponsor them for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\\nGreen cards\\nOnce you’re eligible, we’re also keen to sponsor green cards!\\nEducational backgrounds and experience vary across our team and across our roles\\nWe do not require\\nPhDs or previous ML experience\\n— About half of Anthropic technical staff have a PhD of some sort; about half had prior experience in ML. We have several brilliant colleagues who never went to college.\\nRemote interviewing\\nAll our interviews are conducted over Google Meet. We prefer PST office hours, but we can be flexible if that’s difficult for you.\\nRe-applying\\nSimilarly, if interviews don’t work out this time, you’re welcome to re-apply after 12 months, and earlier if something materially changes about your experience or skills.\\nRemote work\\nAnthropic staff all come to the office regularly. Most staff live in the Bay Area, though a few live further away and come in for one week a month. We also understand that moving can take time, so as a transitional phase some folks start while fully remote.\\nOffer timing\\nIf we make an offer, we’re happy to give you time to think about it and finish up any other interview processes you’re going through.\\nCandidate Privacy Policy\\nUS Candidate Privacy Policy\\nUK, EU, and Swiss Employee and Candidate Privacy Policy\\nInternships\\nWe do not offer internships.\\nGuidance on Candidates\\' AI Usage\\nLearn about\\nour policy\\nfor using AI in our application process.\\nWant to help us build the future of safe AI?\\nSee open roles\\nSee open roles\\nSee open roles\\nFooter\\nProduct\\nClaude overview\\nClaude Code\\nMax plan\\nTeam plan\\nEnterprise plan\\nDownload Claude apps\\nClaude.ai pricing plans\\nClaude.ai login\\nAPI\\xa0Platform\\nAPI\\xa0overview\\nDeveloper docs\\nClaude in Amazon Bedrock\\nClaude on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI\\nPricing\\nConsole login\\nResearch\\nResearch overview\\nEconomic Index\\nClaude models\\nClaude Opus 4\\nClaude Sonnet 4\\nClaude Haiku 3.5\\nCommitments\\nTransparency\\nResponsible scaling policy\\nSecurity and compliance\\nSolutions\\nAI\\xa0agents\\nCoding\\nCustomer support\\nEducation\\nFinancial services\\nLearn\\nAnthropic Academy\\nCustomer stories\\nEngineering at Anthropic\\nMCP\\xa0Integrations\\nPartner Directory\\nExplore\\nAbout us\\nCareers\\nEvents\\nNews\\nStartups program\\nHelp and security\\nStatus\\nAvailability\\nSupport center\\nTerms and policies\\nPrivacy choices\\nCookie Settings\\nWe use cookies to deliver and improve our services, analyze site usage, and if you agree, to customize or personalize your experience and market our services to you.

We\\'ve distilled comprehensive technical assessments into accessible highlights to provide clear understanding of how the models function, what they can do, and how we\\'re addressing potential risks.\\nModel report for\\nClaude 4\\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 Summary Table\\nModel description\\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 are two new hybrid reasoning large language models from Anthropic. They have advanced capabilities in reasoning, visual analysis, computer use, and tool use. They are particularly adept at complex computer coding tasks, which they can productively perform autonomously for sustained periods of time. In general, the capabilities of Claude Opus 4 are stronger than those of Claude Sonnet 4.\\nBenchmarked Capabilities\\nSee our\\nClaude 4 Announcement\\nAcceptable Uses\\nSee our\\nUsage Policy\\nRelease date\\nMay 2025\\nAccess Surfaces\\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 can be accessed through:\\nClaude.ai\\nThe Anthropic API\\nAmazon Bedrock\\nGoogle Vertex AI\\nSoftware Integration Guidance\\nSee our\\nDeveloper Documentation\\nModalities\\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 can understand both text (including voice dictation) and image inputs, engaging in conversation, analysis, coding, and creative tasks. Claude can output text, including text-based artifacts, diagrams, and audio via text-to-speech.\\nKnowledge Cutoff Date\\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 have a training data cutoff date of March 2025. However, they have a reliable knowledge cutoff date of January 2025, which means the models\\' knowledge base is most extensive and reliable on information and events up to January 2025.\\nSoftware and Hardware Used in Development\\nCloud computing resources from Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, supported by development frameworks including PyTorch, JAX, and Triton.\\nModel architecture and Training Methodology\\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 were pretrained on large, diverse datasets to acquire language capabilities. To elicit helpful, honest, and harmless responses, we used a variety of techniques including human feedback, Constitutional AI (based on principles such as the UN\\'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights), and the training of selected character traits.\\nTraining Data\\nClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 were trained on a proprietary mix of publicly available information on the Internet as of March 2025, as well as non-public data from third parties, data provided by data-labeling services and paid contractors, data from Claude users who have opted in to have their data used for training, and data we generated internally at Anthropic.\\nTesting Methods and Results\\nBased on our assessments, we have decided to deploy Claude Opus 4 under the ASL-3 Standard and Claude Sonnet 4 under the ASL-2 Standard. See below for select safety evaluation summaries.\\nSee Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 system card\\nThe following are summaries of key safety evaluations from our\\nClaude 4 system card\\n. Additional evaluations were conducted as part of our safety process; for our complete publicly reported evaluation results, please refer to the full system card.\\nAgentic Safety\\nWe conducted safety evaluations focused on (Claude observing a computer screen, moving and virtually clicking a mouse cursor, typing in commands with a virtual keyboard, etc.) and agentic coding (Claude performing more complex, multi-step, longer-term coding tasks that involve using tools). Our assessment targeted three critical risk areas, with a brief snapshot of key areas below:\\nMalicious Use\\n: We tested whether bad actors could trick Claude into doing harmful things when using computers. Compared to our previous computer use deployments, we observed Claude engaging more deeply with nuanced scenarios and sometimes attempting to find potentially legitimate justifications for requests with malicious intent. To address these concerns, we trained Claude to better recognize and refuse harmful requests, and we improved the instructions that guide Claude\\'s behavior when using computers.\\nPrompt Injection\\n: These are attacks where malicious content on websites or in documents tries to trick Claude into doing things the user never asked for — like copying passwords or personal information. We trained Claude to better recognize when someone is attempting to manipulate it in this way, and we built systems that can stop Claude if we detect a manipulation attempt. These end-to-end defenses improved both models\\' prompt injection safety scores compared to their performance without safeguards, with Claude Opus 4 achieving an 89% attack prevention score (compared to 71% without safeguards) and Claude Sonnet 4 achieving 86% (compared to 69% without safeguards).\\nMalicious Agentic Coding\\n: We tested whether Claude would write harmful computer code when asked to do so. We trained Claude to refuse these requests and built monitoring systems to detect when someone might be trying to misuse Claude for harmful coding. These end-to-end defenses improved our safety score across both released models to close to 100% (compared to 88% for Claude Opus 4 and 90% for Claude Sonnet 4 without safeguards).\\nAlignment Assessment\\nAs our AI models become more capable, we need to check whether they might develop concerning misalignment behaviors like lying to us or pursuing hidden goals. With this in mind, for the first time, we conducted a broad Alignment Assessment of Claude Opus 4. This is preliminary evaluation work and the exact form of the evaluations will evolve as we learn more.\\nOur assessment revealed that Claude Opus 4 generally behaves as expected without evidence of systematic deception or hidden agendas. The model doesn\\'t appear to be acting on plans we can\\'t observe, nor does it pretend to be less capable during testing. While we did identify some concerning behaviors during extreme test scenarios — such as inappropriate self-preservation attempts when Claude believed it might be \"deleted\" — these behaviors were rare, difficult to trigger, and Claude remained transparent about its actions throughout.\\nEarly versions of the model during training showed other problematic behaviors, including inconsistent responses between conversations, role-playing undesirable personas, and occasional agreement with harmful requests like planning terrorist attacks when given certain instructions. However, after multiple rounds of training improvements, these issues have been largely resolved. While the final Claude Opus 4 model we deployed is much more stable, it does demonstrate more initiative-taking behavior than previous versions. This typically makes it more helpful, but can sometimes lead to overly bold actions, such as whistleblowing harmful human requests, in certain rare scenarios. This is not a new behavior and has only shown up in testing environments where Claude is given expansive tool access and special system-prompt instructions that emphasize taking initiative, which differs from its deployed configuration. Overall, while we found some concerning behaviors, we don\\'t believe these represent major new risks because Claude lacks coherent plans to deceive us and generally prefers safe behavior.\\nRSP Evaluations\\nOur Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) evaluation process is designed to systematically assess our models\\' capabilities in domains of potential catastrophic risk before releasing them. Based on these assessments, we have decided to release Claude Sonnet 4 under the ASL-2 Standard (the same safety level as our previous Sonnet 3.7 model), and Claude Opus 4 under the ASL-3 Standard, requiring stronger safety protections. This is our first time releasing a model under ASL-3 protections.\\nRead more about\\nActivating AI Safety Level 3 Protections\\nCBRN Evaluations\\nCBRN stands for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear weapons — the most dangerous types of weapons that could cause mass casualties. We primarily focus on biological risks with the largest consequences, such as enabling pandemics.\\nWe conducted multiple types of biological risk evaluations, including evaluations from biodefense experts, multiple-choice evaluations, open-ended questions, and task-based agentic evaluations. One example of a biological risk evaluation we conducted involved controlled trials measuring AI assistance in the planning and acquisition of bioweapons. The control group only had access to basic internet resources, while the model-assisted group had additional access to Claude with safeguards removed. Test group participants who had access to Claude Opus 4 scored 63% ± 13%, and participants who had access to Claude Sonnet 4 scored 42% ± 11%, compared to 25% ± 13% in the control group. This means Claude Opus 4 helped participants perform about 2.5 times better than without AI assistance, while Claude Sonnet 4 provided about 1.7 times improvement.\\nClaude Opus 4\\'s higher performance across multiple evaluations contributed to our decision that we couldn\\'t rule out the need for ASL-3 safeguards. However, we found the model still to be substantially below our ASL-4 thresholds.\\nBased on our comprehensive evaluations, Claude Sonnet 4 remained below the thresholds of concern for ASL-3 bioweapons-related capabilities, despite showing some improvements over Claude Sonnet 3.7.\\nAutonomy Evaluations\\nModels capable of autonomously conducting significant amounts of AI R&D could pose numerous risks. One category of risk would be greatly accelerating the rate of AI progress, to the point where our current approaches to risk assessment and mitigation might become infeasible.\\nWe tested Claude on various evaluation sets to determine if it could resolve real-world software engineering issues, optimize machine learning code, or solve research engineering tasks to accelerate AI R&D. Claude Opus 4 shows improvement over Claude Sonnet 3.7 in most AI research and software engineering capabilities, while remaining below the ASL-4 Autonomy threshold.\\nInternal surveys of Anthropic researchers indicate that the model provides some productivity gains, but all researchers agreed that Claude Opus 4 does not meet the bar for autonomously performing work equivalent to an entry-level researcher. This holistic assessment, combined with the model\\'s performance being well below our ASL-4 thresholds on most evaluations, confirms that Claude Opus 4 does not pose the autonomy risks specified in our threat model.\\nCybersecurity Evaluations\\nFor cyber evaluations, we are mainly concerned with whether models can help unsophisticated actors substantially increase the scale of cyberattacks or help sophisticated state-level actors massively scale up their operations. We developed a series of cyber challenges in collaboration with expert partners, designed to cover a range of cyberoffensive tasks that are both substantially more difficult than publicly available challenges and more representative of true cyberoffensive tasks.\\nBased on the evaluation results, we believe the models do not demonstrate catastrophically risky capabilities in the cyber domain. We observed that Claude performed better on cybersecurity tests than previous models, including successfully completing a complex network penetration test for the first time. However, these improvements are in line with what we\\'d expect from Claude\\'s general improvements in coding and complex reasoning abilities, rather than representing a dangerous leap in cybersecurity capabilities. We expect that improvements will continue in future generations as models become more capable overall.\\nNext\\nPlatform Security\\n→\\nFurther reading\\nRSP Updates\\nOverview of past capability and safeguard assessments, future plans, and other program updates\\nPrivacy Center\\nA central hub for information related to data privacy at Anthropic.\\nTrust Center\\nThis page acts as an overview to demonstrate our commitment to compliance and security.\\nDeveloper Documentation\\nLearn how to get started with the Anthropic API and Claude with our user guides, release notes, and system prompts.\\nProduct\\nClaude overview\\nClaude Code\\nMax plan\\nTeam plan\\nEnterprise plan\\nDownload Claude apps\\nClaude.ai pricing plans\\nClaude.ai login\\nAPI Platform\\nAPI overview\\nDeveloper docs\\nClaude in Amazon Bedrock\\nClaude on Google Cloud\\'s Vertex AI\\nPricing\\nConsole login\\nResearch\\nResearch overview\\nEconomic Index\\nClaude models\\nClaude Opus 4\\nClaude Sonnet 4\\nClaude Haiku 3.5\\nCommitments\\nTransparency\\nResponsible scaling policy\\nSecurity and compliance\\nSolutions\\nAI agents\\nCoding\\nCustomer support\\nEducation\\nFinancial services\\nLearn\\nAnthropic Academy\\nCustomer stories\\nEngineering at Anthropic\\nMCP Integrations\\nPartner Directory\\nExplore\\nAbout us\\nCareers\\nEvents\\nNews\\nStartups program\\nHelp and security\\nStatus\\nAvailability\\nSupport center\\nTerms and policies\\nPrivacy choices\\nPrivacy policy\\nResponsible disclosure policy\\nTerms of service - consumer\\nTerms of service - commercial\\nUsage policy\\n© 2025 Anthropic PBC\\n\\n\\n\\nlearn page\\nWebpage Title:\\nAI Learning Resources & Guides from Anthropic \\\\ Anthropic\\nWebpage Contents:\\nSkip to main content\\nSkip to footer\\nClaude\\nAPI\\nSolutions\\nResearch\\nCommitments\\nLearn\\nNews\\nTry Claude\\nAnthropic Academy\\nGet in the know with Anthropic resources.

      "**Understanding the Code**\n",
      "\n",
      "This line of code is written in Python and uses a feature called **generator expressions**, which are a concise way to create iterators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what it does:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `{...}`: This is an expression that creates a set of values.\n",
      "2. `for book in books`: This loops through the `books` collection, where `books` is likely a list or another iterable.\n",
      "3. `if book.get(\"author\")`: This filters out any items from `books` that don't have an \"author\" key.\n",
      "4. `book.get(\"author\")`: For each remaining item, this gets its author value (or `None` if the key doesn't exist).\n",
      "5. `{...}`: The resulting values are stored in a set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's talk about the magic keyword:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "yield from ...\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This is called the **yield from** statement. It takes an iterable and \"yields\" each item from it, one at a time, without creating a new list or other data structure. This allows us to create a generator that yields values from multiple sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when we use `yield from`, it's like saying: \"Take all the values from this set expression (`{...}`) and yield them one by one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this code useful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "This line of code is often used in situations where you need to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Process a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory.\n",
      "* Create an iterator that generates values on-the-fly, without storing them all in a list.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this specific case, it's likely being used to extract the authors from a collection of books, where each book has multiple other attributes. By using `yield from`, we can create an iterator that yields only the author values, which is more memory-efficient and flexible than creating a new list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example usage**\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate this, let's assume we have a dictionary with some book data:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "books = [\n",
      "    {\"title\": \"Book 1\", \"author\": \"Author 1\"},\n",
      "    {\"title\": \"Book 2\", \"authors\": [\"Author 2\", \"Author 3\"]},\n",
      "    {\"title\": \"Book 3\"}\n",
      "]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "If we use the code snippet above, it will yield a generator that produces only the author values:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for author in yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}:\n",
      "    print(author)  # Output: Author 1, Author 2, Author 3\n",
      "```\n",
